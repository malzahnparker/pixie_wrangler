- press 1 or 2 to switch between drawing normal lines or tunnels. (tunnels are more expensive)
- "release" button won't do anything unless all paths are connected
- (not implemented yet) if differently flavored pixies have to share a line, there will be traffic congestion
- (not implemented yet) angles equal to or more acute than 90 degrees will slow pixies down
